# Getting Started

Please ensure you have the following installed beforehand:
- NodeJS and NPM
- MongoDB

1. Put the code into a desired directory.
2. Open Terminal, `cd` to the aforementioned directory.
3. Run `npm install` to install the necessary NodeJS dependencies.
4. Run `mongod` or `sudo mongod`, whichever works first.
5. Open a new tab in Terminal and `cd` to the aforementioned directory if at all necessary.
6. Run `npm start`.
7. Navigate to `localhost:8080` in a web browser. If you have the environment variable `PORT` set, navigate to `localhost:<PORT>` instead.
